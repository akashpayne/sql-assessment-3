A predator-prey simulation involving foxes and rabbits in
an enclosed rectangular field.

An additional simulation has been produced of Bacteria and 
Glucose in a small enclosed rectangular area.

How to start:

    Create a Simulator object: 
        + By typing either "Animal" or "Organism" into the 
          simulator when it is called,will call the corresponding 
          view one of the simulations. 
          
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
