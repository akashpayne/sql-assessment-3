CO657 Assessment 5: Aggregation and Visualisation
Deadline: 25th January, 23:55

Multiple Mbed Sender Devices that communicate to a Mbed Control Device, via Xbee Wifi and located in various positions, easily moved about before set. 

Each Mbed Sender Device tracks motion on a door and displays relative modes (open/closed and alarmed/notAlarmed) via LCD on the Application Shield. 

Each Mbed Sender Device has the ability to plug in and play providing the mbed device has the same code loaded and a new device ID. 

The Mbed Controller has an attached HTTP Server that runs a webpage allowing a user to set an alarm and view, which Device is Alarmed / Opened / Closed. 

The Javascript runs the RPC handlers for communication of the web page.
