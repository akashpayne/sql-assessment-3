Snake application is a retro/classic game in which the player controls a snake that moves 
around a board. The objective is to eat the food that gets randomly placed on a board, with 
each item that the snake eats, it grows in length and equally the player earns points that go 
towards a score, the aim is to beat the “high-score” that is saved into a file and kept for 
later uses. The player loses the game when the snake either collides with its tail, or a wall.

PROJECT TITLE:
CO520 - Assignment 4 - A GUI for a Game - Game of Snake
@Author: Akash Payne - ap567
@Version: SnakeApplication2.0
@Date: 03/04/2014

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
The assignment task is to build a simple GUI for a simple game of your choice. Ideas for 
suitable games might be Matching Hidden Pairs (e.g., of pictures), Connect 4, Minesweeper, or 
a game of your own devising. Important: The emphasis of the assessment is on the design and 
implementation of the user interface, not the game logic. For instance, you are not being asked 
to write a program that is capable of playing a game but one that would support one or two 
humans to play the game on a single computer.
In addition to the program source code, you are required to submit a short plain text report 
about the components you have used.
